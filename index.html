        <h2>About <span>Me</span> </h2>
        <p>
          I am a qualified biotechnologist turned web developer. I have always been curious about the tech field and I found the fast-paced growth of this field so enticing that I could not resist learning more about it. Over the past few years, I have had a growing interest in software development and decided to join a course that would teach me more.
          It has not been easy and my mindset was tested to its limits at times, and that is exactly what made me love this field even more. I was looking for a fun challenge, that would make for a fulfilling career. I am confident that I have found that in web development.
          Besides my love for coding, I also enjoy reading, drawing, painting, and learning chess!</p>

          <h3>Smart-Brain (Face-Recognition) App</h3>
          <p>This project combines frontend and backend development to bring you an exciting display. 
          A user can register a profile, which they can use to sign in. Once signed in, said user may upload a URL of a photo that contains a face. The Smart-Brain will then detect that face and highlight it using a box that surrounds the area of the face! Go ahead and try it out, and do not be afraid to play around with a fun nickname for yourself! Enjoy!</p>

          <h3>Background Generator App</h3>
          <p>Have you ever started building a project with a design and colour-scheme in mind...
          Only to get stumped by the possibility of having to search through and test dozens of colour-schemes? Well fear not, this app has come to your rescue! You can play around with the colour-picker to test out how a gradient background would look. And if you are not looking for anything specific and feel like having fun, simply click the "Random" button to generate random hex values for random colours!</p>
